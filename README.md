## üìò VLSI Lab -Hierarchical vs Falatten work flow

### üîπ YoSys Synthesis and Netlist Generation

Below is a generalized YoSys script for synthesizing any RTL design and generating a clean gate-level netlist:
you can also refer the [day_1]() for detailed work flow 
```
# Start of YoSys script

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Read the standard cell library
read_liberty -lib <library_file>.lib

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Read your Verilog RTL design
read_verilog <rtl_file>.v

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Synthesize top module
synth -top <top_module_name>

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Map synthesized design to the library using ABC
abc -liberty <library_file>.lib

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Insert D flip-flops using the library (if needed)
dfflibmap -liberty <library_file>.lib

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Flatten the hierarchy (optional)
flatten

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Write the final netlist to Verilog with no attributes
write_verilog -noattr <output_netlist>.v

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Show the design in YoSys GUI
show
```

### üîπ Notes on Important Commands

write_verilog -noattr:

Exports the synthesized design into a clean Verilog file.

Removes unnecessary attributes/metadata like (* keep = 1 *), making it easier to read and simulate.


flatten:

Combines all modules into a single hierarchy, removing sub-module boundaries.

Useful to analyze the full gate-level netlist and for synthesis comparisons between hierarchical vs flattened designs.
