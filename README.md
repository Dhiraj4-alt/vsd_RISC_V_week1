# üåéVSD RISC-V Tapeout Program ‚Äì Week 1 

Welcome to Week 1! This week, we'll start with the basics of Verilog RTL design and synthesis. You'll learn how to write Verilog code that describes the behavior of circuits and simulate it using tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave. We'll also look at timing concepts, testbenches, and how synthesis converts your RTL code into gate-level circuits. By the end of the week, you'll understand how to optimize designs, avoid common mistakes, and see the full RTL-to-gate-level flow in action. Each day focuses on a specific topic, from introduction to optimizations, so you can follow along step by step.

## üïëPrerequisites 

Before starting Week 1, you should be familiar with installing and setting up some open-source EDA tools, which will be used throughout the week.  
The main tools are:  
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** ‚Äì for compiling and simulating Verilog RTL designs  
- **Yosys** ‚Äì for synthesizing RTL code into gate-level netlists  
- **GTKWave** ‚Äì for viewing waveforms generated during simulation

Detailed installation instructions and setup steps for these tools can be found in the **Week 0 repository**:  [vsd_RISC_V_week0](https://github.com/Dhiraj4-alt/vsd_RISC_V_week0).  

Make sure these tools are installed and working before proceeding, as they are essential for lab exercises and simulations in Week 1.

## üìùLearnings


During Week 1, I worked extensively on Verilog RTL design, synthesis, and optimization, covering topics from basic RTL coding, timing libraries, hierarchical vs flat synthesis, to combinational and sequential optimizations, GLS, and blocking vs non-blocking statements. I simulated over 70-90 files using Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, YoSys, and Sky130 PDK. This hands-on experience helped me gain strong practical skills and familiarity with key VLSI design and verification tools, boosting both my confidence and understanding of real-world hardware design workflows. It also makes me evenüöÄ more enthusiastic to build a career in the VLSI industry.
