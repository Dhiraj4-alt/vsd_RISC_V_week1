# VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program â€“ Week 1 
Welcome to Week 1! This week, we'll start with the basics of Verilog RTL design and synthesis. You'll learn how to write Verilog code that describes the behavior of circuits and simulate it using tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave. We'll also look at timing concepts, testbenches, and how synthesis converts your RTL code into gate-level circuits. By the end of the week, you'll understand how to optimize designs, avoid common mistakes, and see the full RTL-to-gate-level flow in action. Each day focuses on a specific topic, from introduction to optimizations, so you can follow along step by step.
## Prerequisites 
The Prerequisites included some topics like how to install some Open Source EDA tools like Yosys and Iverilog and GTKwave this tools will be used in following days of the week 
it can be accesed in the following [vsd_RISC_V_week0](https://github.com/Dhiraj4-alt/vsd_RISC_V_week0)
